                    q: 'A researcher enrolls patients with stroke and without stroke, then looks back at their aspirin use. What study design is this?',
                    options: ['Randomized controlled trial', 'Cohort study', 'Case-control study', 'Cross-sectional study'],
                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: 'This is a case-control study: participants are selected based on outcome status (stroke/no stroke) and exposure history (aspirin) is assessed retrospectively.'
                },
                {
                    q: 'Which measure of association is most appropriate for a case-control study?',
                    options: ['Risk ratio', 'Odds ratio', 'Risk difference', 'Incidence rate'],
                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'The odds ratio is the appropriate measure for case-control studies because you cannot calculate incidence (and thus risk ratios) when sampling is based on outcome.'
                },
                {
                    q: 'A clinical trial randomizes patients to alteplase vs placebo. The outcome assessors do not know the treatment assignment. This is an example of:',
                    options: ['Single blinding', 'Double blinding', 'Triple blinding', 'Open-label design'],
                    answer: 0,
                    explanation: 'When only the outcome assessors are blinded (but patients and clinicians know the assignment), this is single blinding of assessors. Double blinding would require patients and clinicians to also be blinded.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'In a stepped-wedge design, all clusters cross over from control to intervention at randomly determined time points, so every cluster eventually receives the intervention. This is useful when withholding an expected beneficial intervention is not ethical.'

                    answer: 3,
                    explanation: 'Performance bias occurs when knowledge of treatment assignment affects behavior of participants or providers. Knowing the assignment leads to differential reporting of outcomes.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'The p-value is the probability of observing results as extreme as (or more extreme than) those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It is NOT the probability that H0 is true.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'Because the CI includes 1.0 (the null value for OR), the result is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. A CI that crosses the null value corresponds to p > 0.05.'

                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: 'I-squared represents the percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. Values of 25%, 50%, and 75% are conventionally considered low, moderate, and substantial heterogeneity (Higgins et al., 2003).'

                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: 'NNT = 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.05 = 20. This means you need to treat 20 patients to prevent one additional bad outcome.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'RR = Risk in exposed / Risk in unexposed = (50/1000) / (20/1000) = 0.05 / 0.02 = 2.5. Exposed individuals have 2.5 times the risk of disease.'

                    answer: 2,
                    explanation: 'Stratified analysis (e.g., Mantel-Haenszel) is an analysis-stage method for controlling confounding, not a design-stage method. Randomization, restriction, and matching are all design-stage approaches.'
                },
                {
                    q: 'The incidence rate of stroke in a population is 2 per 1,000 person-years. If 5,000 people are followed for 2 years, approximately how many strokes would you expect?',

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'Temporality (the cause must precede the effect) is the only one of Bradford Hill\'s criteria that is considered necessary for causation. All others provide supporting evidence but are not required.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'Adequate random sequence generation is the most critical element for internal validity as it is the primary mechanism for preventing selection bias and ensuring comparability of groups at baseline.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'RoB 2.0 (Risk of Bias tool version 2) is the Cochrane-recommended tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials. Newcastle-Ottawa is for observational studies, QUADAS-2 for diagnostic studies, and AMSTAR-2 for systematic reviews.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis includes all randomized participants regardless of compliance and is generally more conservative, preserving the benefit of randomization. Per-protocol analysis can introduce bias by excluding non-compliant patients.'

                    answer: 1,
                    explanation: 'Large effect size is one of three factors that can upgrade certainty in GRADE (along with dose-response gradient and effect of plausible confounding). Risk of bias, imprecision, and publication bias are reasons to downgrade.'

            options: ['Cohort study', 'Case-control study', 'Cross-sectional study', 'Ecological study'],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: 'A cross-sectional study measures exposure and outcome at the same point in time. Because there is no follow-up and no temporal sequence established, this is cross-sectional.'
        },
        {
            q: 'A group of 10,000 nurses free of cardiovascular disease are enrolled and followed for 20 years, with periodic assessment of diet and incident MI. What study design is this?',
            options: ['Randomized controlled trial', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Case-control study'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'This is a prospective cohort study: a defined population is assembled, exposure (diet) is measured at baseline and during follow-up, and the outcome (MI) is ascertained over time going forward.'

            q: 'Using hospital discharge records from 2010-2020, researchers identify patients who had DVT and compare prior oral contraceptive use to matched controls without DVT. What study design is this?',
            options: ['Prospective cohort study', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Case-control study', 'Cross-sectional study'],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: 'Participants are selected based on outcome (DVT vs no DVT) and exposure is ascertained retrospectively from records. This is the hallmark of a case-control design.'

            options: ['Randomized controlled trial', 'Quasi-experimental study', 'Cohort study', 'Case-control study'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'Allocation based on bed number is systematic but not truly random. This is a quasi-experimental (non-randomized interventional) study because the intervention is assigned but without proper randomization.'

            options: ['Cohort study', 'Case-control study', 'Ecological study', 'Cross-sectional study'],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: 'An ecological study uses aggregate (population-level) data rather than individual-level data. The unit of analysis is the country, not the person, making it susceptible to the ecological fallacy.'

            options: ['Randomized controlled trial', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Pragmatic trial', 'Case series'],
            answer: 0,
            explanation: 'This is a classic randomized controlled trial (RCT): patients are randomized to intervention groups and followed to an endpoint. It could also be pragmatic, but the core design is an RCT.'
        },
        {
            q: 'Investigators compare outcomes between patients who chose surgery vs. conservative management for lumbar stenosis, using propensity score matching. What design is this?',
            options: ['Randomized controlled trial', 'Prospective cohort study with propensity adjustment', 'Case-control study', 'Cross-sectional study'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'This is an observational cohort study because exposure (surgery) is not randomized but self-selected. Propensity score matching is used to reduce confounding by indication, but it does not make this an RCT.'

            q: 'Ten patients with a rare autoimmune encephalitis are described in detail, including demographics, treatment, and outcomes. No comparison group exists. This is a:',
            options: ['Case-control study', 'Case series', 'Cohort study', 'Cross-sectional study'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'A case series is a descriptive study of a group of patients with a specific condition, without a comparison group. It is useful for rare conditions but cannot establish causation.'

            options: ['Selection bias', 'Recall bias', 'Lead-time bias', 'Attrition bias'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'Recall bias occurs when cases report past exposures differently (usually more thoroughly) than controls because their disease status motivates them to search for explanations. This is a type of information bias.'
        },
        {
            q: 'A study of hospital patients finds a strong association between two diseases that is absent in the general population. This discrepancy is due to:',
            options: ['Confounding', 'Berkson bias', 'Misclassification bias', 'Ecological fallacy'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'Berkson bias (admission rate bias) occurs when hospital-based sampling creates a spurious association because the probability of hospitalization differs by disease status. Both diseases independently increase hospitalization probability.'

            q: 'A screening program detects cancer earlier but does not change the time of death. Survival from diagnosis appears longer. This phenomenon is called:',
            options: ['Length-time bias', 'Lead-time bias', 'Detection bias', 'Immortal time bias'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'Lead-time bias occurs when earlier detection by screening shifts the time of diagnosis forward without actually extending life, making survival time from diagnosis appear longer than it truly is.'

            q: 'In a cohort study, 30% of the unexposed group is lost to follow-up while only 5% of the exposed group is lost. This may cause:',
            options: ['Confounding', 'Recall bias', 'Attrition bias (differential loss to follow-up)', 'Immortal time bias'],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: 'Differential loss to follow-up (attrition bias) occurs when the reasons for dropout differ between groups. This can distort the association if those lost differ from those remaining in outcome risk.'
        },
        {
            q: 'A pharmacoepidemiologic study compares outcomes of a new drug vs. an old drug, but the new drug group has "immortal" person-time before the first prescription. This is:',
            options: ['Lead-time bias', 'Immortal time bias', 'Confounding by indication', 'Healthy user bias'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'Immortal time bias arises when a period of follow-up during which the outcome cannot occur (because the subject must survive to receive the exposure) is misclassified or included in the exposed group, creating a spurious protective effect.'

            q: 'A non-differential misclassification of a binary exposure in a cohort study will generally bias the estimate of association toward:',
            options: ['Away from the null', 'Toward the null', 'It has no predictable direction', 'Toward an odds ratio of 2.0'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'Non-differential misclassification of a binary exposure (where the error rate is the same in diseased and non-diseased) biases the risk ratio or odds ratio toward the null (toward 1.0). This is a well-established principle in epidemiology.'

            q: 'A study finds that coffee drinking is associated with lung cancer risk. However, the association disappears after adjusting for smoking. The unadjusted result was likely due to:',
            options: ['Selection bias', 'Recall bias', 'Confounding', 'Effect modification'],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: 'Confounding occurs when a third variable (smoking) is associated with both the exposure (coffee) and the outcome (lung cancer) and distorts their apparent relationship. Adjustment for smoking removes the confounding.'

            q: 'You want to compare mean systolic blood pressure between two independent groups (drug A vs. placebo). Data are normally distributed. The appropriate test is:',
            options: ['Paired t-test', 'Independent samples t-test', 'Chi-squared test', 'Mann-Whitney U test'],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: 'An independent samples t-test compares means of a continuous, normally distributed variable between two independent groups. Since the groups are independent (different patients), and data are normal, this is the correct choice.'
