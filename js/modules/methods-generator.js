The treatment effect was quantified as the absolute risk difference with its 95% confidence interval, along with the relative risk and number needed to treat (NNT). A pre-specified per-protocol analysis was conducted as a sensitivity analysis, restricted to participants who completed the study without major protocol violations. Subgroup analyses were performed for [pre-specified subgroups] using interaction tests between treatment assignment and subgroup variable in a logistic regression model.

Normality of residuals was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test and visual inspection of Q-Q plots. If the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used as a sensitivity analysis, with the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of location shift and its 95% confidence interval. A mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used for longitudinal secondary outcomes, with an unstructured covariance matrix, including terms for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value, and stratification factors.

The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by examining scaled Schoenfeld residuals and testing for a time-by-treatment interaction; if violated, a time-varying coefficient or restricted mean survival time (RMST) analysis was planned. Participants who were event-free at the end of follow-up or lost to follow-up were censored at their last known alive date. Competing risks were handled using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model, with the subdistribution HR reported alongside the cause-specific HR.

Balance of covariates between groups was evaluated before and after adjustment using standardized mean differences (SMD), with an SMD <0.10 considered indicative of adequate balance. The primary analysis used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) with stabilized weights, trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the influence of extreme weights. The average treatment effect (ATE) was estimated using a weighted [Cox / logistic / linear] regression model. Sensitivity analyses included: (1) propensity score matching using nearest-neighbor 1:1 matching with a caliper of 0.2 standard deviations of the logit of the propensity score; (2) doubly robust estimation combining IPTW with outcome regression; (3) the E-value to assess the robustness of findings to unmeasured confounding.

Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran\'s Q test (with significance at P<0.10 due to low power) and quantified using the I-squared statistic, interpreted as: <25% low, 25-75% moderate, >75% high heterogeneity. The prediction interval was reported to convey the range of true effects expected in future similar studies. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted using random-effects meta-regression with the Knapp-Hartung adjustment for the confidence interval of the pooled estimate. Publication bias was assessed visually using a funnel plot and statistically using Egger\'s regression test (for continuous outcomes) or the Peters test (for binary outcomes with ORs). If publication bias was suspected, the trim-and-fill method was applied as a sensitivity analysis. A leave-one-out analysis was performed to assess the influence of individual studies.

Positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95% CIs were derived. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated to assess overall discriminative ability, with 95% CI estimated using the DeLong method. The optimal threshold was determined by maximizing the Youden index (J = sensitivity + specificity - 1). For comparison of two diagnostic tests, the difference in AUC was tested using the DeLong test for paired ROC curves. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and calibration plots.
