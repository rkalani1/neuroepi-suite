# Neuro-Epi

**Comprehensive epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical research platform.**

A zero-dependency static web app built for clinical researchers, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and clinical trialists. Designed for daily use in study design, data analysis, grant writing, manuscript preparation, and critical appraisal.

- **Critical Appraisal** — RoB 2.0, Newcastle-Ottawa, AMSTAR-2, QUADAS-2, GRADE.
- **Reporting Guidelines** — Interactive CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA checklists with progress tracking and export.

### Meta-Analysis
- **Meta-Analysis** — Fixed and random effects (DerSimonian-Laird with optional HKSJ), forest plots, funnel plots, Egger's test, leave-one-out sensitivity, cumulative meta-analysis, trim-and-fill.

### ML & Prediction

### Writing & Productivity
- **Grant Assistant** — Specific aims page builder, study design section, power justification text, Gantt timeline, human subjects template, budget calculator.
- **Methods Generator** — Auto-generate statistical methods paragraphs for manuscripts, common templates for RCTs, observational studies, meta-analyses.
- **Project Planner** — Research timeline builder, milestone tracker, budget calculator, regulatory checklists.

### Cross-Cutting Educational Features
